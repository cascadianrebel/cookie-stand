      <p>When Pat Solman graduated from college, she set out to become the worlds best limnic endocrinologist. She had  dreams of finding a way to allow for her favorite animal, the Coho salmon, to live for years after spawning. She was close to restoring her favorite Coho's hormone levels  until one fateful October when her research camp was ransacked by a cascadian sasquatched, named Morris. Morris is a jerk.  
        
        <img class= "inLinePic" src="img/frosted-cookie.jpg"  alt="A frosted Salmon cookie">
        
       Morris destroyed all of Pat's research. Her beakers were shattered, her salmon specimen were ripped appart, and even her food supply was targetted.  When Pat submitted her report to National Park Service, the junior forester, Tom Parr, took a special interest. He couldn't recover any of her research but he was able to recover some bits and peices of her Salmon specimen and food supply. <img class= "inLinePic" src="cutter.jpg" alt="a salmon cookie cutter">
        Sarcastically, Pat replied "What am I going to do with this? Bake cookies?" She was so driven by her sarcasm that she actually ended up making cookies. Tom loved them and shared the sarcasticookies with the other foresters. 
        Pat's Salmon Cookies were loved by the mountain men and women and were requested over an over until Pat gave up on her dream of being the world's best limnin endocrinologist in favor of opening up her first cookie store.
        Pat and Tom were married less than a year later and the cookies warranted 4 additional Salmon cookie stores. They now employ their children as free labor.
